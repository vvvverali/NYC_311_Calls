# NYC 311 Calls Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the New York City 311 call data. The analysis aims to uncover insights into the types and frequencies of complaints reported by NYC residents.

## Contents
- Data loading and preprocessing: The notebook starts by importing necessary libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, prophet, and sklearn) and loading the 311 call data from a pickle file.
- Data exploration: The notebook includes cells for exploring the dataset, including reviewing columns, data types, and basic statistics.
- Analysis: The main part of the notebook consists of various analyses on the 311 call data, focusing on aspects such as agency-wise call distribution, complaint types, and temporal trends (these are assumed based on the first few cells).

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, prophet, sklearn
- The dataset: `Project-3_NYC_311_Calls.pkl` (must be placed in the `shared` directory)

## Usage
1. Ensure you have Python installed and the required libraries.
2. Place the dataset in the correct directory.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook to perform the analysis. Each cell is documented for ease of understanding and can be executed in sequence.
